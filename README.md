## Syntax

## Grammar
```
program        → declaration* EOF ;
declaration    → funDecl | varDecl | statement ;

funDecl        → "fun" function ;
function       → IDENTIFIER "(" parameters? ")" block ;
parameters     → IDENTIFIER ( "," IDENTIFIER )* ;

varDecl        → "var" IDENTIFIER ( "=" expression )? ";" ;

statement      → exprStmt | ifStmt | printStmt | returnStmt | whileStmt | block;
exprStmt       → expression ";" ;
ifStmt         → "if" "(" expression ")" statement ( "else" statement )? ;
printStmt      → "print" expression ";" ;
returnStmt     → "return" expression? ";" ;
whileStmt      → "while" "(" expression ")" statement ;
block          → "{" declaration "}" ;

-- Grammar Rules with Precedence --
expression     → assignment ;
assignment     → IDENTIFIER "=" assignment | logic_or;
logic_or       → logic_and ( "or" logic_and )* ;
logic_and      → equality ( "and" equality )* ;
equality       → comparison ( ( "!=" | "==" ) comparison )* ;
comparison     → term ( ( ">" | ">=" | "<" | "<=" ) term )* ;
term           → factor ( ( "-" | "+" ) factor )* ;
factor         → unary ( ( "/" | "*" ) unary )* ;
unary          → ( "!" | "-" ) unary | call ;
call           → primary ( "(" arguments? ")" )* ;
arguments      → expression ( "," expression )* ;
primary        → NUMBER | STRING | "true" | "false" | "nil" | "(" expression ")"  | IDENTIFIER ;

-- Base Grammar for AST --
expression     → literal | unary | binary | grouping ;
literal        → NUMBER | STRING | "true" | "false" | "nil" ;
grouping       → "(" expression ")" ;
unary          → ( "-" | "!" ) expression ;
binary         → expression operator expression ;
operator       → "==" | "!=" | "<" | "<=" | ">" | ">=" | "+"  | "-"  | "*" | "/" ;

### Note: I haven't worked on the following features:
1. for loops
2. Semantic Analysis
3. OOP
